#Sufs UP!

In this challenge, we were asked to do some analysis on weather statistics for the island of Oahu in Hawaii in order to set up a Surf and Ice cream Shop. 
We used Jupyter notebook and SQLAlchemy to query the hawaii.sqlite database. I looked specifically at June and December to ensure investors that the store would be a success regardless of month!
